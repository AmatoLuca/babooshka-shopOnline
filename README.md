This project is a mini, very mini e-commerce app.

It had to be implemented with a shopping cart and 

session, to keeping the cart status. 

It also had to be provided by database accesses.

It was a Java project made together with my partner in a final step of a Java course.

I took care of the graphic part following my personal taste.

I used HTML, CSS, JS and BOOTSTRAP.
